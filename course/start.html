    <P align="left">This CD is part of the book,<I>Vowels and Consonants </I>published by Blackwells. It is meant to be used in conjunction with the book, and is not self explanatory. The CD will work on any computer that has a net browser, such as Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Explorer. It has been optimized for use on Netscape Navigator, which is included (with permission from Netscape) on the CD. If you started by clicking on the CD you are now using this program. It has a special application included, theWebPlayer, which not only plays each recording when you click on a word, but also brings up a menu that allows you to make an acoustic analysis of the last sound that has been played. (The &quot;About box&quot; in the menu that appears when you play a sound gives further details.) If you are using any other browser you should copy theWebPlayer from this CD to your hard disk, and make it the application to use to play sounds. Consult your browser's Help files to find out how to do this.</P>
    <P align="left">      <P align="left">The CD also includes an Appendix containing most of the sounds described in another book by Peter Ladefoged: <I>A Course in Phonetics</I>, Harcourt College Publishers, 2000.</P>
